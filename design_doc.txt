Scam Jam 2021 Game Design Document

== CONCEPT ==
You're a flea market salesperson/random suave asshole and you got shit to sell.
Luckly, people are pretty dumb. They're just *begging* you to take their munny 
in exhance for random crap!!

== GAMEPLAY ==

The game sees the player trying to sell objects to people in order to make as 
much money as possible. The player gets a brief description of the next customer 
to scout out things they might want to buy and what things to say in order for 
them to buy it.

After seeing the customer overview, the player gets presented with 3 objects and 
must pick one to try and sell to the customer. After picking the object, dialogue 
options will appear in sets of 3, and the player must keep picking the options that 
will persuade the customer in the right direction. Correct options will make the 
customer appear more happy, and wrong options will make the customer appear more 
angry. However, the customer may catch on to your lies and bs if you pick too 
many positive options. The player can choose to stop the persuasion at any point 
after 3 rounds of dialogue, in which then they will suggest a price for the object. 
The MSRP of the object will be shown, and the player can choose to inflate or lower 
the price to their seeing. A charmed customer is more likely to pay for an inflated 
price tag, while angry customers will probably not buy it for more than a few cents.
